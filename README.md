This is the repo for the final year project: Overkill Reloaded

things to add:

change hud elements that access the enemy spawner actor to do a valid check first 



use eqs for spawning enemies and enemy behaviour


ricochet for bullets

punch through for bullets

dodging 



shop (change it so that after you beat the boss instead of just increasing the current wave you go to the shop and when you exit it the current wave advances) ((use a random number to determine what kind of upgrade each slot has in the shop ui blueprint)



add stats screen to see upgrades

add power ups (inf ammo, nuke, coin vacuum)



implement glass cannon mode and extreme mode



add different enemy types, like ones that are faster and shoot at the player 



change assets to further reflect games theme (sound effects, models and font used in the ui)
